## Introduction

The open Home Automation Bus (openHAB) project aims at providing a universal integration platform for all things around home automation. It is a pure Java solution, fully based on OSGi. The Equinox OSGi runtime and Jetty as a web server build the core foundation of the runtime.

It is designed to be absolutely vendor-neutral as well as hardware/protocol-agnostic. openHAB brings together different bus systems, hardware devices and interface protocols by dedicated bindings. These bindings send and receive commands and status updates on the openHAB event bus. This concept allows designing user interfaces with a unique look&feel, but with the possibility to operate devices based on a big number of different technologies. Besides the user interfaces, it also brings the power of automation logics across different system boundaries.

For further Information please refer to our homepage http://www.openhab.org. The release binaries can be found in the ['releases' section on Github](https://github.com/openhab/openhab/releases). Nightly Snapshot-Builds can be obtained from [Cloudbees](https://openhab.ci.cloudbees.com/job/openHAB/).
