/**
 * The resume program function removes the currently running event providing the event is not a mandatory demand
 * response event. The top active event is removed from the stack and the thermostat resumes its program, or enters the
 * next event in the stack if one exists. This function may need to be called multiple times in order to resume all
 * events. Sending 3 resume functions in a row will resume the thermostat to its program in all instances.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that vacation events cannot be resumed, you must delete the vacation event using the
 * {@link DeleteVacationFunction}.
